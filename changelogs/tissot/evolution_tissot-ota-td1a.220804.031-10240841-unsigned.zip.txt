This is Android 13 with October 2022 security patches

Notes:
==============================
- If your device bootloops, revert to an older build that boots, backup your stuff and do a clean flash.
- Dirty flash from Android 12.1 to Android 13 at your own risk.
- Dirty flash from older A13 builds is fine.
- We're not responsible for any issues that this may cause.
